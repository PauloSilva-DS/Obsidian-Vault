Hello! I'm here to help you with your query. Based on the chat history, it seems that you are trying to generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers in Python. Unfortunately, the code you provided failed to run due to an undefined variable.

To fix this error, you can try using the `reduce()` function in a more structured way. Here's an example of how you could implement the Fibonacci sequence in Python:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Test the function with some inputs
print(fibonacci(5)) # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(8)) # Output: 21
```
You can also use a recursive approach to implement the Fibonacci sequence:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Test the function with some inputs
print(fibonacci(5)) # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(8)) # Output: 21
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
